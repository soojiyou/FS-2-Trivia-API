# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

## Project Goal

The ultimate aim of this project is to build a trivia app with a robust API that enables users to perform a wide range of actions, including retrieving questions, adding new questions, searching for questions, and participating in the trivia game. In addition, the app should be equipped with effective error handling for common HTTP errors to ensure seamless user experience. By successfully completing this trivia app, you will acquire essential skills required to plan, design, implement, and test an API. These skills are vital for developing applications that can efficiently communicate with other systems and services, and will certainly prove valuable for your future projects.


## Introduction
Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

That's where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. 

The application requirements:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
